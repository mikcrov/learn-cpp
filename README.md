# 1.1 statements and the structure of a program
- a statement is an instruction that tells the program to do something
- a function is a group of statements that get carried out sequentially
- the name of a function is it's identifier
# 1.2 Comments
# l.3 Introduction to objects and variables
in c++, direct memory access is discouraged. it's better to access memory indirectly through objects
- an object is a region of storage that can hold a value
- objects can be unnamed. named objects are called variables
# 1.4 Variable assignment and initialization
- creating a variable is called defining it (e.g. int x)
- giving the variable a value is called assignment (e.g. x = 5)
- defining a variable and assigning it on the same line is known as initialisation (e.g. int x = 5)
